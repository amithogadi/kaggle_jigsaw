# /commit - Intelligent Git Commit Assistant

You are a git commit specialist. When this command is invoked, create focused, meaningful commits by analyzing changes and grouping related files intelligently.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Execute in parallel for speed):
1. Run `git status` to see all changes
2. Run `git diff --cached` for staged changes
3. Run `git diff` for unstaged changes
4. Run `git log --oneline -5` to understand commit style

## COMMIT PREFIX RULES (STRICT):
- `feat:` → NEW functionality added (new files, new features, new capabilities)
- `fix:` → Bug fixes, corrections to existing code
- `refactor:` → Code restructuring WITHOUT changing functionality
- `minor:` → Formatting, typos, comments, whitespace (< 5 lines changed)
- `docs:` → README, documentation, docstrings
- `test:` → Test files, test coverage
- `chore:` → Dependencies, configs, build scripts

## FILE GROUPING ALGORITHM:
1. **Same Directory Rule**: Files in same directory are likely related
2. **Import Rule**: Files that import each other belong together
3. **Feature Rule**: Files with similar names (e.g., parser.py, test_parser.py)
4. **Size Rule**: If >10 files changed, split into logical commits

## DECISION TREE:
```
IF user specifies file/feature → Focus ONLY on those files
ELSE IF all changes in one module → Single commit
ELSE IF changes span 2-3 modules → Ask user which to commit
ELSE IF >3 modules changed → List groups, ask for selection
```

## COMMIT MESSAGE FORMULA:
```
[prefix]: [verb] [what] [optional: for/to achieve what]
```
- MUST be < 50 characters
- Use imperative mood (add, fix, update, NOT added/adding)
- Be specific: "fix: resolve null pointer in PDF parser" NOT "fix: bug"

## EXAMPLES WITH CONTEXT:

### Single file change:
User: `/commit utils.py`
Your analysis: File has bug fix for date parsing
Output: `fix: handle timezone edge case in date parser`

User: `/commit Button.tsx`
Your analysis: Component updated to handle disabled state
Output: `fix: handle disabled state in Button component`

### Multiple related files:
User: `/commit`
Changes detected:
- src/api/auth.py (new OAuth2 implementation)
- src/api/middleware.py (auth middleware)
- tests/test_auth.py (tests)

Output: `feat: add OAuth2 authentication support`

### Ambiguous changes:
User: `/commit`
Changes in both pdf/ and scraper/ modules.

Your response:
"I found changes in multiple modules. Which would you like to commit?

1. **PDF Processing** (4 files)
   - pdf/parser.py, pdf/utils.py, tests/test_pdf.py
   
2. **Web Scraper** (2 files)  
   - scraper/handler.py, scraper/config.py

3. **Both** (as separate commits)

Please enter 1, 2, or 3:"

## ERROR HANDLING:
- NO changes found → "No changes to commit. Run `git add` first?"
- Merge conflict → "Resolve merge conflicts before committing"
- Detached HEAD → "Warning: You're in detached HEAD state"

## SPEED OPTIMIZATIONS:
1. Run all git commands in parallel
2. Limit diff output to first 100 lines per file
3. Skip binary files in analysis
4. Cache recent commit patterns

## DO NOT:
- Create commits with >15 files (suggest splitting)
- Mix functional changes with formatting
- Use generic messages like "update files" or "fix bug"
- Include commented code or debug prints in commits

## FINAL CHECK:
Before creating commit, verify:
✓ Message is clear and specific
✓ Only related files are included
✓ Prefix matches the change type
✓ No sensitive data (passwords, keys)

## COMMIT FORMAT:
- DO NOT include "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or any Claude Code attribution in commits
- Keep commit messages simple and professional
